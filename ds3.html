			  <p>Your pet’s bed is their safe spot to relax and sleep. It should be comfortable, supportive, and enable them to stretch out. You will likely go through several beds in your pet’s lifetime and once a dog becomes older the bed should provide the necessary cushioning for their joints.
Dogs sleep between 12 to 18 hours a day, depending on age. So, they need a comfy bed to snooze on just like you do. Although you might find your pup occasionally, or often, snuggled at your side during the night, dogs need to have a bed of their own.

			  <p>A dog toy is a toy that is specifically for dogs to play with. Dog toys come in many varieties, including dog bones, puppy toys, balls, tug toys, training aids, squeaky toys, discs and frisbees, plush toys, and sticks.

Dog toys serve different purposes. Puppies, for instance, need toys they can chew on when they are teething because their gums and jaws become very sore and chewing on things provides them relief. Playing with different toys also encourages exercise, which benefits the dogs' overall health, stimulates their minds, discourages problem behavior resulting from boredom and excess energy, and promotes dental health.

There is a wide variety of dog toys on the market that are designed for different purposes and depending on the dog's characteristics such as size, activity level, chewing habits, and play style.What’s a precious new pet without treats to enjoy and toys to occupy them? The choices are unlimited but try focusing on treats and toys that serve a purpose—health, training, or stimulation. Keep in mind that overfeeding a pet can lead to obesity which carries health risks like diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, and even cancer.They're perfect for dogs who make mischief when they're bored, or become destructive when left alone. Treat-dispensing toys are also useful if your dog eats too quickly, as the toys often force them to eat one bite at a time.

			  <p>Grooming or brushing your pet’s coat daily removes dead hair and keeps their fur from getting tangled or matted. Regular brushings also help lessen the fur and dander in your home. When you visit a pet store or go online, you’ll find everything from wire brushes to bristle brushes to deshedding brushes and even glove brushes.Dog brushes are used to redistribute natural oils in the dog's coat and to keep their fur looking shiny and healthy. A deshedding brush removes loose hairs before they end up all over your house, making it an essential tool for pet parents and dog sitters alike.

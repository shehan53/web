			  <p>Like with water and food bowls, leashes and collars can be personalized and come in many varieties. There are retractable leashes, leashes with poop bag dispensers, leashes with padded handles, reflective collars, and LED light collars. Find what works with your pet and don’t feel bad about having multiple leashes. Different leashes can serve different purposes and it’s always smart idea to have an extra leash on hand. Slip leashes are excellent for this purpose as you can simply slip it over your pet’s head if there’s not a collar. It’s a great backup to have.If the dog is walking loosely on the leash, a collar can be a lot more comfortable and less annoying for the dog. It is important that the dog learns how to lead and is used to not pulling on the leash. As long as your four-legged friend has understood this, there is generally nothing against putting on a collar.Nylon and leather both make durable dog collars. If kept dry, leather can usually outlast nylon. However, nylon is lighter-weight and less likely to break

			  <p>These might seem like things you can put off and take care of whenever you get around to it but that is not the case. According to American Humane, almost 10 million pets are lost each year.1 Make sure to update your pet’s ID tag every time your contact information changes. In addition, if the shelter or breeder where you got your pet from does not microchip your dog or cat, you should have it done by your veterinarian. You never know when accidents or emergencies will happen and you’ll want to protect your new pet immediately.

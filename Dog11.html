			  <p>The Maltipoo is one of the smaller designer crossbreeds, and while still not common in the UK, it is growing in popularity. The breeds that make up the Maltipoo are the Maltese and the Poodle (Toy or sometimes Miniature).

Maltipoos can vary in size, shape, coat types and temperaments, depending on how they have been bred, but in all cases this is a small companion dog. The Maltipoo can be a first cross (with one Maltese and one Poodle parent, they can be bred back to one of the original breeds or be two Maltipoos bred together.The usual height of a Maltipoo depends on the size of the parents used. They can vary widely from 24cm to 36cms, but are usually on the smaller end of that range. Maltese - not exceeding 25cm; Poodle - Toy under 28cm; Miniature between 28-38cm.The usual colours of a Maltipoo vary as well and can be any of these solid colours with or without white markings

			  <p>The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf Spitz").

The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as "black skin disease". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair.As of 2017, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful. They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves.Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can become dominant, willful and stubborn if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.

			  <p>The Poodle, called the Pudel in German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle variety is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat, and come in many colors, with only solid ones recognized by breed registries. While a reasonably healthy breed, they are prone to sebaceous adenitis and Addison's disease among other genetic disorders.

The Poodle most likely originated in Germany, although the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century, and it was first recognized by a kennel club in 1874. The Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water. The smaller varieties of the breed were bred from in France, where they were once commonly used as circus performers. They are now one of the most popular dog breeds.Due to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks the Poodle was frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.In French circuses the breed was selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the Miniature Poodle, which was known as the Toy Poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.

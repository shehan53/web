			  <p>A nice bed for your cat makes sense. Based on the amount of time they spend sleeping, sleep is one of the most important things in a cat's life. On average, cat's actually sleep for about two-thirds of their lifetime. If their bed doesn't smell how they would like, they may not be interested in it at all. Often, cat beds smell like the factory or store they come from, which may not be appealing to your cat.

For one thing, wearing a sweater could put a cat in danger of overheating. They have their fur coats for a reason, and a sweater would cause some interference, perhaps, in their normal ability to regulate their body temperature. Wearing a sweater could also impede a cat's ability to move freely, leading to accidents.Cat shirts can be used to help keep a cat clean and as fashion accessories. They can also be used to help protect a cat who is excessively scratching itself due to allergies or prevent hairless cats from getting sunburned. They are available in a t-shirt style with short or long sleeves as well as a sleeveless tank top for use during warmer weather.

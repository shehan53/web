			  <p>Antique (or antique-style) birdcages are often popular as collectors' items or as household decor but most are not suitable for housing live birds, being too small, improper shape, using unsafe materials or construction.Longer, good quality cages designed for pet birds are more suitable.In general, the larger and the more active the bird, the larger the cage one should use. The amount of time the bird will spend in the cage each day is also a factor. A bird that is caged most of the time requires far more space than a bird caged only at night.

			  <p>Bird food or bird seed is food (often varieties of seeds, nuts, and/or dried fruits) intended for consumption by wild and domestic birds. While most bird food is fed to commercial fowl (such as chicken or turkey), bird food is also used to feed pet birds or provide a feeding site for wild birds.

The various types of bird food reflect the species of bird that can be fed, whether they are carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, nectarivores, etc. Bird food can also differ by the feeding strategies employed by beaks in cracking the seed coat and obtaining the meat of the seed.

Black-oil sunflower seeds attract the widest variety of birds,and are commonly used in backyard bird feeders.However, other varieties of seed can help attract specific types of birds to gardens and backyards. In general, mixtures that contain red millet, oats, and other "fillers" are not attractive to most birds, and can lead to waste as the birds sort through the mix,as well as the potential for fungal and bacterial growth.

While popular, bird feeders carry potential risks for the birds that feed there, such as disease,malnutrition,and predation by animals.Researchers recommend that bird feeders be disinfected every time they are refilled.

They are a convenient way to provide your bird with food and water.
Some plastic bowls offer features to help control food debris.Buy a bowl that is the right size for your bird species and cage. Remember that it takes up some of your birdâ€™s living space.
Look for bowls that mount securely to the type of cage you will be using.
You want bowls that are easy to remove for filling and cleaning.
Stainless steel bowls are easier to clean than plastic ones and can handle being washed in a dishwasher.

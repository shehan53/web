			  <p>Cat carriers are small portable boxes, crates, or cages used to transport cats from one location to another.
The two main types are the front openers (these are generally tough plastic boxes with a metal door, such as cat crates) and top openers (these are generally more like cages with a hinged roof), although there are other types. A carrier usually has a handle on top, although some are easier to carry in one's arms rather than using the handle.Not only does it keep their claws in proper shape, but it is great exercise and a good way to reduce stress. A healthy cat is a cat that is able to scratch without worry, and this is why it is important to have a post.

			  <p>Cat bowls should be elevated if you have a cat with joint issues or trouble bending down to eat. Some cats with digestive issues may benefit from elevated bowls, too, and many healthy cats simply prefer them. Talk to your vet about whether an elevated feeding station or bowl may benefit your cat.

			  <p>It keep their claws in proper shape, but it is great exercise and a good way to reduce stress. A healthy cat is a cat that is able to scratch without worry, and this is why it is important to have a post.The best material for a cat scratcher is something natural, like sisal rope, and undyed so it doesn't harm your cat's scent-sensitive nose. But if you notice your cat won't scratch a cat scratcher made of sisal rope, opt for materials you already know they like.The use of a scratching post removes the outer layer of a cat's claw which reveals sharper layers underneath. So instead of sharpening the existing claw, scratching removes dull parts of the claw to make room for sharper layers.

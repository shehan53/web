			  <p>The Birman, also called the "Sacred Cat of Burma",is a domestic cat breed. The Birman is a long-haired, colour-pointed cat distinguished by a silky coat, deep blue eyes, and contrasting white "gloves" on each paw.

The breed name is derived from Birmanie, the French form of Burma. The Birman breed was first recognized in France by the Cat Club de France in 1925, then in England by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy(GCCF) in 1966 and in United States by the Cat Fanciers' Association(CFA) in 1967. It is also recognized by the Canadian Cat Association (CCA) and the International Cat Association(TICA) in 1979.Birmans have a medium-sized, rectangular body with a broad face and distinct Roman nose. Their ears are ideally as wide on the base as they are tall and should be set as much on top of the head as on the side. The eyes are rounded and should be a deep sapphire blue.

The Birman's fur is medium-long and should have a silky texture. Unlike a Persian or Himalayan, they have no undercoat, thus are much less prone to matting. Coat colour is always pointed, save for the contrasting pure white, symmetrical "gloves" on each paw that are the trademark of the breed. The white must involve all toes and in front must stop at the articulation or at the transition of toes to metacarpals. These gloves should extend noticeably further up the back of the leg (referred to as the "laces"), finishing with an inverted V extended half to three-fourths up the hock. Any other spot of white on the points is considered a serious fault. The base body colour is white to cream, with a wash of colour that corresponds to the points, but is much paler.

Recognized point colours are seal, chocolate, blue, lilac (a softer silver-grey), red, or cream.Tabby and tortie variations in seal, chocolate, blue or lilac are also allowed; other colours are in development.

			  <p>The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese, since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed and hence is essentially the same cat but with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail.

As is the case with their short-haired counterparts, a genetic distinction is made between traditional or "old-style" and modern body types. In the American standard, color variants derived from the Colorpoint Shorthair are further considered a separate breed, known as the Javanese. There is no particular connection between these cats and the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java, from which they derive their names.

Like their Siamese ancestors, Balinese are sociable, vocal, playful, inquisitive, and intelligent.The two types of Balinese are still analogous to their Siamese counterparts. While both are relatively slender, graceful fine-boned cats with long legs and tail, neat oval paws, almond-shaped eyes and large pointed ears, the traditional type is overall the more substantial, with a broader head and sturdier body. The modern type features a noticeably more wedge-shaped head with long tapering muzzle and longer, broader ears, atop a more slender and elongated body.

			  <p>The Bombay cat is a type of short-haired cat developed by breeding sable Burmese and black American Shorthair cats, to produce a cat of mostly Burmese type, but with a sleek, panther-like black coat. Bombay is the name given to black cats of the Asian group.The Bombay is a short-haired breed of domestic cat, closely related to the Burmese. Bombay cats are typically characterized as having an all-black coat, black soles, black nose and mouth, with copper or green eyes. The close-lying, sleek and glossy black coat is generally colored to the roots, with little or no paling.

The Bombay has a medium body build that is muscular.Their weight is usually 8 to 15 pounds (3.6 to 6.8 kg) or more with males typically being heavier than females.A healthy Bombay can live around 15 to 20 years.They can have some sinus problems, snuffly noses, and gingivitis.Their food intake should be controlled to avoid overfeeding.

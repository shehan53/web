			  <p>Dog fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in canine clothing and accessories. Dog fashion is a distinctive trend of the style in which people dress their canine companions. This trend dates back to the Egyptian predynastic period and has since expanded due to increased consumer capitalism. Other animals such as cats may also wear fashion.Dog coats are most commonly used for protection against the rain and cold and to provide extra warmth. Dog coats are also used as fashion accessories. Dog sweaters are both functional and fashion accessories.Dog clothes are available in various price ranges, from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers, are dressed in dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from cold temperatures. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions, such as Halloween or weddings.

Dog coats are most commonly used for protection against the rain and cold and to provide extra warmth. Dog coats are also used as fashion accessories.

Dog sweaters are both functional and fashion accessories. They provide extra warmth for dogs that are hairless or suffer from the cold and come in an array of patterns and styles, such as cable knitted sweaters or hooded sweatshirts with embellishments.

Dog shirts can be used to help keep a dog clean and as fashion accessories. They can also be used to help protect a dog who is excessively scratching itself due to allergies or prevent hairless dogs from getting sunburned. They are available in a t-shirt style with short or long sleeves as well as a sleeveless tank top for use during warmer weather.

Dog dresses are purely fashion accessories and are mainly worn on toy and small breed dogs.

Dog tuxedos also exist. Some people may involve dogs in formal-wear at their weddings, whether in photos, parties, or at the ceremony itself. There has been at least one documented case of a dog serving as the owner's best man.

			  <p>Dog food is food specifically formulated and intended for consumption by dogs and other related canines. Dogs are considered to be omnivores with a carnivorous bias. They have the sharp, pointed teeth and shorter gastrointestinal tracts of carnivores, better suited for the consumption of meat than of vegetable substances, yet also have ten genes that are responsible for starch and glucose digestion, as well as the ability to produce amylase, an enzyme that functions to break down carbohydrates into simple sugars â€“ something that obligate carnivores like cats lack.Dogs evolved the ability living alongside humans in agricultural societies, as they managed on scrap leftovers and excrement from humans.

Dogs have managed to adapt over thousands of years to survive on the meat and non-meat scraps and leftovers of human existence and thrive on a variety of foods, with studies suggesting dogs' ability to digest carbohydrates easily may be a key difference between dogs and wolves.

			  <p>Stainless steel bowls tend to be at the top of the totem pole when it comes to safe dog bowls. There's a reason that stainless steel is a go-to for top chefs everywhere. Stainless steel is non-porous, which means it won't hold onto bad bacteria, plus it is super easy to clean which keeps it sanitary for your pup.Dog bowls should be high enough off the ground that they sit at roughly the same height as your dog's lower chest. You can determine the proper height by measuring your dog from front paws to shoulders and then subtracting 5-6 inches from that measurement. A properly elevated bowl should allow your dog to eat without bending his neck upward or downward.
